    <h2>ACT 1<h2>
        
    <h3>PROLOGUE<h3>
        
      
        

<p> In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
<p> From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
<p> Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
<p> From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
<p>  A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
<p> Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
<p> Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
<p> The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
<p> And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
<p> Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</p>
<p> Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
<p> The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
<p> What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
